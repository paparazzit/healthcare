                Production of conventional PU and memory foams of the highest quality is what we are, next to a wide assortment of final products, recognized worldwide.
                </p><p>
                In block production, we own a continuous max foam/lay-down foaming line for flexible PU foam. On the 250 m long foaming line, we have been producing 20 and 40 m long flexible PU foam blocks within the density range from 18 to 80 kg/m3. More than 40 dosing lines allows us to foam a wide range of foam types and densities:

                Molded pillow production has been managed by the most advanced robot line technology. The foam’s chemical components must be precisely mixed and injected into a prepared mold.
                </p><p>

                The unique production technique that includes high-quality molds allows us to produce an identically shaped pillow with perfect contours and edges. Using molds, we can create all those shapes that cannot be obtained by simply cutting off a foam block.
                </p><p>
                The factory in Serbia can produce 15 different dimensions and shapes of molded pillows:

                <p>Per customer requirements, pillows can be produced with a gel pad. Different fragrances can be infused as well.</p>
                <p>The hardness of pillows can also be adjusted by customer requirements. The pillow can be made with or without holes to improve airflow.</p>

                Most often, we choose renowned suppliers so we can be able to strictly control quality bats to guarantee better lead time. Of course, you can choose to use your own supplier’s fabrics, own labels, embroidery, and ribbons.
                </p><p>
                Tailoring and sewing halls own modern machines for fabric processing. Among them, there are 4 single–needle quilting machines, 3 multi-needle quilting machines, two embroidery machines with 20 heads, and 136 kits of sewing machines. Modern quilting machines and embroidery machines allow us to give you a choice between almost unlimited designs for quilting and embroidery motives. This option allows for a more luxurious design, better comfort, and a fantastic possibility to represent your brand through the elements you decide you want. You may choose cover quilting with high-quality hollow fiber or numerous

                </p><p>
                For toppers and mattresses packaging, we use three strong pressing devices that allow us to compress, vacuum into PET foil, roll up and finally pack our products into retail or transport boxes of an appropriate size. We pack pillows through a highly effective line that allows vacuuming and rolling them up, or, if you so choose to, they can come in classic packaging – non-woven bag, box, foil, or similar.

       <p> These types of foam carry the mark “M,” and we produce them in various densities (18 – 35 kg/m3 ). They have wide usage in the upholstery industry and sleeping equipment industry.These foam types are most often used as a mattress and topper base in our factory.</p>

      <p>  Products can be made only of conventional foam or combined with different layers of memory, smart, or other foam sorts to achieve some specific comfort and usages. Conventional PU foams are highly durable and elastic, which allows them to stand pressure and weight without permanent deformity.

        <p>HR foam is known for its improved elasticity. Its cellular structure enables high elasticity and optimal level of support, so a mattress made of this foam can be classified as mattresses with emphasized ergonomic orthopedic properties.</p>

        <p>If standard foam’s elasticity is in a range of 30 – 45%, the elasticity of HR foam is above 50%. This shows that extreme resilience and durability are some of the significant characteristics of HR foam. It has a bouncy sensation akin to the one caused by springs.</p>

        <p>HR foams can be equally valuable as a mattress and topper base and as one of the upper layers</p>.

      <p>  The most popular type of foam you can find on the market is memory foam. Memory foam has the unique feature of slow recovery after pressure (“slow recovery” effect) and progressive adaptation to the shape of the sleeper’s body, the influence of body temperature and the environment.</p>

       <p> The core of the mattress, topper, or pillow, made using layers of memory foam, provides an exceptional feeling of relaxation, as the foam of these characteristics distributes the body pressure evenly at all points of support.</p>

       <p> We produce TDI-based memory foams (“P”) within a wide density range of 40 – 80 kg/m3 and MDI-based AirCell® foam in a density range of 28 – 40 kg/m3.</p>

        <p> With gel particles infused into the cell structure, our memory and AirCell® foam can provide a cooling effect.</p>

       <p> This type of polyurethane foam is also called “latex-like.” The name comes from being remarkably similar to natural latex. It is characterized by its rubber-like elasticity but also exceptional tenacity and comfort.</p>

     <p>   The advantage of Smart foam™, relative to natural latex, is its open-cell structure that enables easy airflow and constant ventilation of the mattress core or topper. Densities range from 50-55 kg/m3.</p>

    <p>It is most commonly used for making pillows, mattresses, and surface layers because it is very adaptable and soft.</p>
