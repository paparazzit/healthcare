    <h2>History</h2>
    <div class="text-content">
        
        <p>Every story has its beginning, and ours begins in <span>2003</span> when Mr. Ni Zhanggen founded our parent company <span>HealthCare Co.</span> Ltd. The first factory was built in Nantong City in the southeastern Jiangsu province of China. Since then, it has become one of China’s largest memory foam manufacturers.
        </p>
       <p> In <span>2012</span>, our company has been established in <span>Novi Sad, Serbia</span>, with only a few dozen employees. The same year, we signed a Memorandum of Understanding, which entails further development of a total of <span>1200 employees</span> and impressive production capacities.</p>

      <p>  Two years later, in <span>2014</span>, the company moved to <span>Ruma</span>, where factory construction was underway. The factory’s construction was only the first step out of planned 50-million-euro investments into Serbia. </p>

      <p>The factory opened in <span>2015</span> and subsequently began its production of a broad assortment of sleeprelated products and foams. Our success is achieved through utilizing the latest technological possibilities on the market.</p>

<p>Today, our factory spans more than <span>60.000</span> square meters. It has 4 manufacturing facilities, where we conduct a complete production cycle – from the very foams we use to the final sleep product of the finest quality.</p>

<p>We employ more than <span>700</span> diligent workers and continue expanding and growing our family.</p>
