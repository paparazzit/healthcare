            <div class="prod_info">
                <p>As sleep industry experts, we know how important a mattress for healthy and comfortable sleep is. We also know that each of us has different sleep needs.</p>
                <p>Therefore, in our factory, we create the highest quality and various mattress models to respond to your request as best as possible. From softer to firmer, through perforated and profiled, those with
                “summer and winter” sides, to the foamy ones and those with pocket springs, are just some of the mattresses found in our offer.</p>
                <p>You can choose between basic one-layered and two-layered mattresses or luxury multi-layered mattresses and those with a detachable topper or with a quilted foam inside the cover.</p>
                <p>To complement the sleep experience, we also have a wide selection of covers that are treated to possess unique properties. We make fabrics with Aloe Vera, bamboo fibers, Tencel, or fabrics with a cooling effect. And, of course, we also have the good old classics – quality cotton and polyester covers.</p>

            <div class="prod_info">
                <p>The most common types of foam mattresses are those that are made entirely out of PU foam. Typically, a
                solid and supportive PU foam is used as a base layer, while the remaining layers can be arranged
                differently.</p>
                <p>They can be made of memory foams of varying densities, foams with natural latex properties, softer standard foams, foams with cooling gel particles, or HR foams.</p>
                <p>This mattress type can be one-sided, where additional layers are added on both sides of the mattress.
                That way, you can achieve different levels of hardness and core function.</p>

            <div class="prod_info">
            <p>The second option is mattresses, whose cores are made from combining various PU foams and pocket
            springs, also known as “hybrid” mattresses. In the base of the core are springs, individually placed in their
            own “pockets”- wrappers made of non-woven textiles.
            </p>
            <p>
            The spring base is tucked into its own frame out of PU foam, which is then encased with layers of different
            memory and standard foams.
            </p>
            <p>
            Their comfort resembles those of traditional mattresses – transfer of movement is more pronounced, as are flexibility and the elasticity of the surface.</p>

                mattress toppers. This convenient product can be made in numerous variations, heights, and dimensions.
                </p><p>
                Starting with hardness, which determines whether the topper will be intended for improving overall comfort or for therapeutic purposes. We can construct toppers out of every type of memory or standard foam or combine various standard, memory, or other foam with unique properties.
                </p><p>
                With the help of the advanced technology we use, machines for cutting and formatting enable toppers to receive special purposes with the help of different profiles. Toppers with a convoluted
                (profiled) cut foam core (pyramid structure), for example, provide a sensation of a mild massage, while the popular profile with 7 support zones provides full muscle relaxation.
                </p><p>
                We can also add unique perforations on the cores to achieve increased air circulation, elevated comfort, and a fresher sleep surface experience.

                Flat-cut toppers are made from standard PU foam of varying densities. These models are most often used
                to restore support to worn-out beds or cover bumps created by wear and tear.
                </p><p>
                Cores derived from pure memory foam are used to improve the bed's overall comfort, soften stiff surfaces, and for pain relief purposes. Namely, the unique property of memory foam is precisely in its even distribution of pressure. This relieves the body of tension, stiffness, and pain.
                </p><p>
                Prevalent alternatives are toppers made of a combination of standard and memory foam. The product derived in such a way contains great characteristics of both types of materials.

            <div class="prod_info">
            <p>Thanks to advanced cutting machines, we can provide additional properties to our toppers. For example, the core can be profiled into a pyramid. That way, end buyers will enjoy the feeling of a mild massage and additional stimulation and relaxation of the whole-body musculature.
            </p><p>
            The “seven-zoned” convoluting is particularly popular. Namely, different profiles on the core provide fully
            customized support for different body regions.
            </p><p>
            Profiling can also be done on toppers out of standard, as well as those that have memory foam cores. We
            can also do special perforations and core drilling, to improve the air circulation and the whole comfort.</p>

                Depending on the technology you choose, we make different types of pillows.
                </p>
                <p>
                Based on your needs, we make cut pillows of different shapes, molded pillows derived by pouring foam into various molds, or classically shaped pillows filled with memory and standard foam flakes.
                </p><p>
                Although they significantly differ by hardness and properties, molded pillows and those cut from a block have certain advantages and are produced in multiple forms. The most popular are contour pillows and “soap” shaped pillows, but the assortment is significantly wider.
                </p><p>
                In our assortment, you can find ergonomically shaped pillows, lumbar pillows, neck travel pillows, anti-snore, pillows intended for people who sleep exclusively on their side, and other kinds. In
                addition to different dimensions and heights, you can also choose pillows with other uses, such as decorative ones, for sitting or pillows for pregnant women and babies.</p>

                </p><p>

                The most popular shapes in which they are produced are the anatomical shape, or contour, and the rounded rectangular shape known as the “soap.”
                </p><p>
                Variations in terms of dimensions can be ranged. The cores can also be multi-layered, thus gaining

            </p><p>
            Molded pillows are derived from memory foams of higher densities, making them highly adaptable, very
            supportive, and completely homogenous and smooth structure. Currently, we can produce about 15 various shapes of molded pillows of memory foam, available in different dimensions.</p>
